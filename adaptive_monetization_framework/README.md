# Adaptive Monetization Framework

This repository contains an AI-driven monetization system designed to autonomously evolve its strategies based on market conditions, user behavior, and ecosystem feedback. The system leverages reinforcement learning for real-time decision-making and integrates with the broader Evolution Ecosystem.

## Components

1. **DataCollector**: Collects market trends, user interactions, and ecosystem feedback.
2. **StrategyEvaluator**: Analyzes current monetization strategies and provides performance insights.
3. **RLAgent**: Implements reinforcement learning for dynamic strategy adjustments.
4. **RiskAssessor**: Evaluates risks associated with different monetization strategies.
5. **Integrator**: Integrates the framework with external systems like the knowledge base and user dashboard.
